# Refactoring Summary: TF-IDF Baseline Model

## Overview
The TF-IDF baseline model code has been refactored to improve maintainability and code organization by extracting utility functions into a separate module.

## Changes Made

### Before Refactoring
- **File**: `main_tfidf_baseline.py` (~580 lines)
- **Structure**: All code in a single file
- **Issues**: Long file, duplicate utility logic, harder to maintain

### After Refactoring
- **Main file**: `main_tfidf_baseline.py` (418 lines) - **29% reduction**
- **Utilities file**: `utilities.py` (~240 lines)
- **Total**: 658 lines (with better organization)

## Extracted Functions

The following functions were extracted from `main_tfidf_baseline.py` into `utilities.py`:

### 1. Data Loading
- **`load_dataset_from_hf()`** (previously `load_data()`)
  - Loads dataset from HuggingFace Hub
  - Handles subset selection for quick experiments
  - Returns train, validation, and test splits

### 2. Model Evaluation
- **`evaluate_classifier()`** (previously `evaluate_model()`)
  - Evaluates model performance on a dataset split
  - Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
  - Generates confusion matrix and classification report
  - Returns comprehensive metrics dictionary

### 3. Feature Importance
- **`print_feature_importance()`**
  - Prints top positive and negative features per class
  - Helps interpret which words influence predictions

### 4. Output Management
- **`setup_output_directory()`**
  - Creates timestamped output directory for results
  - Ensures parent directories exist

### 5. WandB Integration
- **`init_wandb_if_available()`**
  - Safely initializes WandB if available
  - Handles missing WandB gracefully
  
- **`log_to_wandb()`**
  - Logs metrics to WandB if initialized
  
- **`finish_wandb()`**
  - Finishes WandB run if active

### 6. Results Management
- **`save_results_to_json()`**
  - Saves results dictionary to JSON file
  - Handles numpy type conversion

### 7. Summary Printing
- **`print_training_summary()`**
  - Prints final training summary
  - Shows test accuracy, F1-score, and output location

## Benefits

### ✅ Improved Maintainability
- Utility functions can be reused across multiple models
- Main file focuses on model logic, not infrastructure code
- Easier to test individual utility functions

### ✅ Better Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Main file is 29% shorter and more readable
- Utilities can be imported by future models

### ✅ Consistency
- All models can use the same evaluation and logging functions
- Reduces code duplication across model implementations

### ✅ Extensibility
- Easy to add new utility functions without cluttering main file
- Other models (LSTM, BERT, etc.) can import these utilities

## Usage

### In main_tfidf_baseline.py:
```python
from model_phase.utilities import (
    load_dataset_from_hf,
    evaluate_classifier,
    print_feature_importance,
    setup_output_directory,
    init_wandb_if_available,
    log_to_wandb,
    finish_wandb,
    save_results_to_json,
    print_training_summary
)
```

### Running the model (unchanged):
```bash
python model_phase/main_tfidf_baseline.py --dataset username/dataset-name
```

## Next Steps

Future models (LSTM, BERT, etc.) can import these utilities:
```python
from model_phase.utilities import (
    load_dataset_from_hf,
    evaluate_classifier,
    setup_output_directory,
    # ... other utilities
)
```

This ensures consistent evaluation and reporting across all models!
