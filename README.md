## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- **Stable internet connection**

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/auphong2707/sentiment-analysis-for-game-review.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-for-game-review
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```

4. **Test connectivity** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python test_connection.py
   ```
   This will verify you can connect to Metacritic before scraping.

5. **Configure environment** (optional)

   ```

## Usage

### Method 1: Interactive Mode (Recommended for Beginners)

The easiest way to start scraping:

```bash
python run_scraper.py
```

This will guide you through:
- Entering the game name
- Selecting the platform
- Setting the maximum number of reviews (optional)

### Method 2: Command Line

Scrape reviews for a specific game by providing the game name and platform:

```bash
scrapy crawl metacritic_reviews -a game_name="the-last-of-us-part-ii" -a platform="playstation-4"
```

### Using Full URL

```bash
scrapy crawl metacritic_reviews -a game_url="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-last-of-us-part-ii"
```

### Limit Number of Reviews

```bash
scrapy crawl metacritic_reviews -a game_name="elden-ring" -a platform="playstation-5" -a max_reviews=100
```

### Custom Output Format

```bash
# Export to JSON
scrapy crawl metacritic_reviews -a game_name="hades" -a platform="switch" -o data/hades_reviews.json

# Export to CSV
scrapy crawl metacritic_reviews -a game_name="hades" -a platform="switch" -o data/hades_reviews.csv
```

### Platform Values

Common platform values for Metacritic URLs:

**PlayStation:**
- `playstation-5` (PS5)
- `playstation-4` (PS4)
- `playstation-3` (PS3)

**Xbox:**
- `xbox-series-x` (Xbox Series X/S)
- `xbox-one` (Xbox One)
- `xbox-360` (Xbox 360)

**Nintendo:**
- `switch` (Nintendo Switch)
- `wii-u` (Wii U)
- `3ds` (Nintendo 3DS)

**PC:**
- `pc` (PC)

### Method 3: Batch Processing with Python Script

Create a custom script to scrape multiple games:

```python
import subprocess

games = [
    ("the-last-of-us-part-ii", "playstation-4"),
    ("god-of-war", "playstation-4"),
    ("elden-ring", "playstation-5"),
]

for game_name, platform in games:
    subprocess.run([
        "scrapy", "crawl", "metacritic_reviews",
        "-a", f"game_name={game_name}",
        "-a", f"platform={platform}",
        "-a", "max_reviews=50"
    ])
```

### Popular Games to Try

1. **The Last of Us Part II** - `the-last-of-us-part-ii`, `playstation-4`
2. **Elden Ring** - `elden-ring`, `playstation-5`
3. **Baldur's Gate III** - `baldurs-gate-iii`, `pc`
4. **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** - `the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild`, `switch`
5. **God of War** - `god-of-war`, `playstation-4`
6. **Hades** - `hades`, `switch`
7. **Cyberpunk 2077** - `cyberpunk-2077`, `pc`

## Data Format

The scraper collects the following data for each review:

### Review Data
- `review_id`: Unique identifier for the review
- `review_text`: Full text of the review
- `review_score`: Numerical score (0-100 scale)
- `review_category`: Sentiment category (positive/mixed/negative)
- `reviewer_name`: Username of the reviewer
- `review_date`: Date the review was posted
- `review_url`: URL of the reviews page
- `scraped_at`: Timestamp when the review was scraped

### Game Metadata
- `game_title`: Title of the game
- `game_platform`: Platform (PlayStation 4, PC, etc.)
- `game_url`: Metacritic URL of the game
- `game_metascore`: Critic metascore (0-100)
- `game_release_date`: Game release date (e.g., "Jun 19, 2020")
- `game_genre`: Primary game genre (e.g., "Survival", "Action")
- `game_developer`: Developer name (e.g., "Naughty Dog")
- `game_publisher`: Publisher name (e.g., "Sony Interactive Entertainment")

### Sentiment Categories

Reviews are automatically categorized based on their score:

- **Positive** (Green): Score 75-100
- **Mixed** (Yellow): Score 50-74
- **Negative** (Red): Score 0-49

## Configuration

### Scrapy Settings

Edit `metacritic_scraper/settings.py` to customize:

- `DOWNLOAD_DELAY`: Delay between requests (default: 2 seconds)
- `CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`: Number of concurrent requests (default: 8)
- `AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED`: Enable automatic throttling (default: True)
- `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY`: Respect robots.txt (default: False)

### Rate Limiting

To be respectful to Metacritic's servers:

- Default delay: 2 seconds between requests
- AutoThrottle enabled to adjust speed automatically
- Concurrent requests limited to 4-8

### Pipelines

Active pipelines (in order):

1. `MetacriticScraperPipeline`: Clean and process data
2. `DuplicatesPipeline`: Filter duplicate reviews
3. `CsvExportPipeline`: Export to CSV with timestamp

To enable JSON export instead, edit `settings.py`:

```python
ITEM_PIPELINES = {
    "metacritic_scraper.pipelines.MetacriticScraperPipeline": 100,
    "metacritic_scraper.pipelines.DuplicatesPipeline": 200,
    "metacritic_scraper.pipelines.JsonExportPipeline": 300,  # Enable this
    # "metacritic_scraper.pipelines.CsvExportPipeline": 300,  # Disable this
}
```

## Output

Scraped data is saved to the `data/` directory with timestamps:

- CSV format: `data/metacritic_reviews_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
- JSON format: `data/metacritic_reviews_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Timeouts

If you see `TCP connection timed out` errors:

1. **Test connectivity first:**
   ```bash
   python test_connection.py
   ```

2. **Verify the game exists:**
   - Go to https://www.metacritic.com/
   - Search for your game
   - Make sure it has user reviews
   - Copy the exact game name from the URL

3. **Try a known working game:**
   ```bash
   scrapy crawl metacritic_reviews -a game_name="the-last-of-us-part-ii" -a platform="playstation-4" -a max_reviews=10
   ```

4. **Increase delays** in `metacritic_scraper/settings.py`:
   ```python
   DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 5  # Increase delay
   CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 1  # Reduce concurrency
   ```

### No reviews found

- Check if the game has user reviews on Metacritic
- Verify the game name matches exactly (use hyphens, lowercase)
- The game might be too new or unreleased (e.g., "Hollow Knight: Silksong")
- Try using the full URL with `-a game_url="..."`

### Rate limiting errors

- Increase `DOWNLOAD_DELAY` in settings
- Reduce `CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`
- Take breaks between scraping sessions

### SSL errors

Add to `settings.py`:
```python
DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS = {
    "http": "scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http.HTTPDownloadHandler",
    "https": "scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http.HTTPDownloadHandler",
}
```

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Web scraping should be done responsibly and ethically.

- **Terms of Service**: Metacritic's robots.txt disallows scraping. Use this tool at your own risk and responsibility.
- **Rate Limiting**: This scraper includes delays and throttling to minimize server load.
- **Personal Use**: This project is intended for educational and research purposes.
- **Data Usage**: Respect copyright and terms of use for any scraped content.

## Next Steps for Sentiment Analysis

After collecting the data, you can:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize review text
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze score distribution, review length, etc.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract features from review text
4. **Model Training**: Train ML models using the labeled data (positive/mixed/negative)
5. **Model Evaluation**: Test model performance on held-out data
